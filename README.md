Project Description: Shoe Store

This project is an online shoe store where I focus on using various JavaScript features to provide users not only with an appealing appearance but also an intuitive and interactive shopping experience. Here are the key features of the project:

Responsive Design: The design of the project is made responsive, meaning that the webpage adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal display on computers, tablets, and smartphones.

Image Slider: The homepage features an image slider that automatically changes backgrounds every 5 seconds, showcasing different images with accompanying text. Users can also manually navigate the slider using arrow buttons.

Bestsellers: A second slider presents the bestselling products. By clicking the arrows, users can browse through various products.

Shoe Categories: Categories include: all, men, women, children. Clicking on them displays the selected shoes.

Search Function: In the shoe collection section, users can use a magnifying glass icon to quickly find their desired shoe model.

Quick View: The "Quick View" button allows users to preview detailed product information in a modal format. Hovering over an image also provides a zoomed-in view of the product.

Add to Cart: Each product has an "Add to Cart" button, allowing users to add items to their cart. After adding, users receive confirmation, and the quantity and total price of items in the cart are updated. Cart items persist even after refreshing the page or leaving the site, enhancing shopping convenience and comfort.

Persistent Cart: Items added to the cart remain even after refreshing the page or leaving the site, enhancing shopping convenience and comfort.

Cart Icon: Leads users to the cart page, where they can manage the cart's content. Users can change quantities and view the total price.

Order and Payment: The "Checkout" button enables users to proceed to the ordering process. If the cart is empty, a message is displayed. Filling in missing fields is required before placing an order.

Contact and Map: The contact section includes the store's location. Clicking opens a map with the store's location.

Email and Phone Interaction: Clicking on the email address or phone number on mobile devices opens the respective application. On desktop, copying content to the clipboard is possible.

Cart and Card Clearing: After completing purchases, the cart and card are cleared using the setTimeout function.

Cookies Usage: The store employs cookies to remember user preferences. After accepting cookies, the notification will no longer appear.
